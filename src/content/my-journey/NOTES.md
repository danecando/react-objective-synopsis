## My Journey - 

### CAREFUL WHERE TIME SPENT : WHAT ATTRACTED ME: DROPNGO - SIMPLE REUSABLE COMPONENTS - ATTENTION / HYPE

With all this in mind, I think we need to be extra considerate of where we invest our time. Whether it be in learning or adopting new frameworks or even the way we go about writing code.

* Not all encompasing like the other more popular frameworks, I could just add it into my site and give it a try
* The idea of simple, reusable components that you combine together to make an interactive and dynamic piece of UI
* It was getting a lot of attention, people were saying it was fast and revolutionary and it was being used in production
by facebook. How could it not be great?
