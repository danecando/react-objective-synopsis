* So maybe you’re hitting a wall with your current tools or you moving into developing more interactive pages or SPA’s and you are looking for something that will help meet your goals with less resistance. That’s what these things are built for anyways right? To help us solve some sort of problem… 
* In my experience the amount of magic in any tool or framework has a strong connection to the amount of technical debt you might incur by using it. Magic is usually synonymous with side effects which we’ll talk about a bit more later on.
* Do people depend on it in production? Is it an active open source project with a passionate community?  Also, this may seem obvious to everyone, it wasn't always to me. Read the source code! (maybe explain why didn't read source codes)
* Depending on your projects goals and requirements or possibly some specific bounds you might be constrained to, for instance integrating with an exisiting application or some other reason. And if you're working with a team on a project, it's important to find out how they feel about it and if it will be a tool that they be comfortable picking up. 
* If you are wanting to learn a framework for yourself, a personal project, or something to give you a leg up in the job market, then these are also very important considerations.  

Do your due diligence!
