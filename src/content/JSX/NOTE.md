## JSX Quick Look

JSX is syntactic sugar that compiles to regular JavaScript. It's an HTML or XML like 
syntax that makes writing our components and developing UI's feel much more natural. 
There was a little bit of controversy about this when React first came out but I think 
people quickly realized that it's much more preferable then writing it all in vanilla JS.
