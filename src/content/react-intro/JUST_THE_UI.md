## ATTRACTED ME, ISNT FULL FRAMEWORK LIKE.., TOOLS 2 COMPOSE UI’S, CATCH 22 OPINIONS

This is one of the first things that attracted me to React. It ISNT a full fledged framework like Angular or Ember. Instead, it just provides the tools needed to compose UI’s in JavaScript. How you structure your app or project is still up to you. Some people prefer a framework with a little more opinion and tooling but this can be a catch 22 situation if you don’t quite agree with the opinions that it imposes on you
